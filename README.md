# Rock Paper Scissors Game

This is my first project using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a simple Rock Paper Scissors game that includes interactive gameplay, styling, and images. The project consists of three main files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `app.js`, along with an `images` folder containing pictures for rock, paper, and scissors.
